# All the President's Tweets #

President Trump has sent 23,787 tweets since taking office in 2017. I downloaded all them from Twitter to analyze his tweeting patterns, and here is what I found in a few graphs. 

Donald Trump had been a prolific tweeter even before he was President, sending out thousands of tweets per year. When he was elected, there was an expectation that he would somewhat mold into the job and become at least a little like all the other presidents that came before him, and this meant tweeting less. But today with nearly all of his presidency behind him, that expectation turned out to be short-lived.
